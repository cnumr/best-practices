**WordPress powers more than a third of the web, 43% in October 2022!**

For what ? ü§î

- Simple to install with many possible additions and great customization without strictly needing to know how a server works, how a database works or even the basics of the code, these are its strong points.
- Even for web professionals, WordPress represents significant development time savings, easy maintenance, quick handling for the client with great autonomy for a lower budget than custom development.

Unfortunately, wanting to be **a solution that meets everyone's needs, it can quickly become obese with a significant environmental impact**. This is why we offer you this repository of good ecodesign practices dedicated to WordPress **which aims to raise awareness, guide, promote and strengthen the ecodesign approach** on existing tools populating the web in a manner consequent.

Discover the best practices We have designed these best practices so that they are as applicable to both **WordPress beginners and web professionals: designers and/or developers and/or administrators**. So on certain best practices, you will find different levels of solutions offered depending on your appetite for design and coding as well as a glossary.

## The contents

The WordPress best practices repository is made up of **33 best practices**¬†grouped according to the following lifecycle:

- Analyse of needs
- Facility
- Conception & Design
- Integration & Development
- Content & media
- Tests & validation
- On-line
- Maintenance
- End of life

In order to facilitate reading and understanding, each good practice describes the subject, offers recommendations accompanied by example(s), one or more validation principles, which are the implementation verification methods, as well as sources where applicable.

The framework also offers indicators: **environmental impact üå± and priority of implementation üëç**, for each of the good practices.
