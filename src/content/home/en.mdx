Our digital uses already represent 40% of our annual sustainable budget, both in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the depletion of the last reserves of non-renewable resources (abiotic resources). That's 10 times too much!

Eco-designing digital services allows us to better control and limit their environmental and health impacts. Under the leadership of Frédéric Bordage, within the Green IT Collective, we have compiled a set of best practices for the eco-design of connected digital services (websites, APIs, SaaS business software packages, etc.) from functional design to hosting, in a framework of over 115 best practices.

<CTAWithIcon label="Discover best practices" url="/en/fiches" target="_self" />

We have designed these best practices to be directly applicable when creating your digital services, enabling you to control the environmental impacts of your productions. This framework allows you to understand, prioritize, and validate the proper application of these best practices, and thus assess the eco-design maturity of your services.

## Content

The 115 best practices in the guide are organized according to two standard life cycle taxonomies (ISO 14040:2006 and ISO 24748-1:2018):

* 1\. Specifications
* 2\. Design
* 3\. Implementation (build)
* 4\. Production (run)
* 5\. Use
* 6\. Support/maintenance
* 7\. End of life

To facilitate reading and understanding, each best practice describes the topic, provides recommendations with examples and a validation principle (implementation verification methods), as well as sources where applicable.

The guide also offers the following indicators:

* Environmental Impact (the best practice's ability to reduce environmental impacts to a greater or lesser extent);
* Implementation (ease or difficulty of implementation);
* Priority Level (rated from 1 to 5 based on the two previous indicators)
* as well as the "third party" impacted and the primary profile in charge of the issue.
