## Description

For example, SQL queries within a loop pose major performance problems, especially if the SQL servers are not on the local machine. These servers are optimised to handle several selections, insertions or modifications in a single query or transaction. Used incorrectly, these queries consume unnecessary CPU cycles, RAM and bandwidth.

## Example

Do not write:

```php
foreach ($userList as $user) {
    $query = 'INSERT INTO users (ﬁrst_name,last_name) VALUES("'. $user['ﬁrst_name'] .'", "'. $user['last_ name'] .'")';
    mysql_query($query);
}
```

but rather:

```php
$userData = array();
foreach ($userList as $user) {
    $userData[] = '("'. $user['ﬁrst_name'] .'", "'.
    $user['last_name'] .'")';
}
$query = 'INSERT INTO users (ﬁrst_name,last_name) VALUES'. implode(',', $userData); mysql_query($query);
```
