## Description

The mobile first strategy consist in designing an online site/service for mobile use, with the associated limited screen space and network, and expand it for larger screen if and only if the functional/ergonomic contribution is justified. In this case, use adaptive loading.

The adaptive loading approach consists in selecting the resources, including JS and CSS files, that are the most suitable for the context of use (screen/window size, pixel density, network quality, amount of RAM, etc.).

These constraints push the design towards a lighter and more efficient web application.

## Exemple

On the server side, the client hints can be used, or the browser's user agent can be recognized to serve adapted content. Be careful : the user agent is not always reliable, and its use is discouraged by the actors of the web. Prefer the client hints or the client side options.

On the client-side, the media queries can be used, as well as, the media attributes of the \<link> tag for the CSS inclusion, the srcset et sizes of \<img> and the whole \<picture> tag the to make responsive images, and the appropriate properties of \<video> et \<audio>. 

The informations provided by the client hints can also be retrieved via JavaScript to choose content dynamically.

In any case, favor a minimalist default mode allowing access to your site even if all its features are not supported by all browsers (without deteriorating the user experience too much of course!).\
