## Description

Server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, Java, etc. are regularly improved by their respective communities. Each new version brings up performance gains, memory management improvements, stability improvements, and security patches. Using the latest language version to take advantage of these benefits is therefore recommended.

## Example

Versions 7 and 8 of PHP have brought significant performance improvements. Additionally, with JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation), PHP 8.0 can compile code parts and store them in memory. JIT optimizes memory management in addition to improving performance.
