## Description

During the specification and design phases, it is recommended to consider the functional and UX limitations of a mobile device (random network, small screen, etc.). When justified (for example, by significant productivity gains, as with an email application), a version for large screens can be considered.

During implementation, various techniques can be implemented, such as adaptive loading, media queries (particularly in the media attributes of `<link>` for CSS style sheet selection), the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes of `<img>`, and the `<source>` sub-elements of `<picture>`, `<video>`, and `<audio>`. \
\
It is also possible to retrieve this information via JavaScript API to potentially load additional code and/or content dynamically. Using server-side user-agent detection is strongly discouraged by web stakeholders.

Using these different techniques helps avoid loading content that would be useless or unusable on a terminal that does not have the required capabilities.

## Example

When defining the application, the team determined that all features could be implemented in a mobile-first manner. However, two features related to the dashboard and status visualization could be much more comfortable if they fully exploited a large screen.

The team decided to use a JavaScript library to load optimized screens if the user had a sufficient screen size.\
