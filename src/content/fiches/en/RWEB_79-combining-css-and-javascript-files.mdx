## Description

Combining CSS style sheets and/or JavaScript libraries reduces the number of HTTP requests.

## Example

In WordPress, the free extensions `Autoptimize `and `Assets CleanUp` make it easy to combine CSS files. With Webpack, the plug-in `webpack-merge-and-include-globally` facilitates the merging of CSS and JavaScript files.
