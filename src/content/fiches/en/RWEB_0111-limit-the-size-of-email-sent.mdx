## Description

Limit the size of sent emails as much as possible when a notification, alert, or confirmation message must be sent by email to the user.
Avoid attachments and embedded images. By sharing a link to cloud file storage, you prevent your attachments from being duplicated on as many email servers as there are recipients.
Keep content short. If necessary, use plain text instead of HTML.
If you absolutely must decorate your email, use CSS styles instead of images.

Compress your email's HTML code with a tool like [https://htmlcompressor.com/compressor/](https://htmlcompressor.com/compressor/)

## Example

Sending an email confirming the receipt of a contact request doesn't necessarily justify adding HTML code and images. A basic HTML message uses on average:
at least two images (the logo and a signature at the bottom of the page), or approximately 10 KB;
12 KB of HTML code for layout (inline styles, tables, etc.);
4 KB of text (the message and the two action links).

Ultimately, an HTML email weighs 26 KB, while a plain text email weighs 4 KB, a saving of 22 KB per email sent. In the case of a transactional site with, for example, customer and internal alerts, the potential savings become considerable. The number of emails sent over 1MB is zero.
