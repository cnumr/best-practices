## Description

Javascript/CSS animations can be very CPU-intensive and consume a lot of memory.\
They all trigger a resource-intensive (re)paint/(re)flow action. Animations should be avoided as much as possible, and used only when essential.

If you can't do without animation, limit yourself to the CSS3 properties `opacity` and `transform`, and the associated transform functions `translate`, `rotate` and `scale`. These two properties are automatically optimized by the browser, and the animation can be handled by the graphics processing unit (GPU). The [www.csstriggers.com](https://csstriggers.com/) website lists the DOM actions triggered by an animation.

To minimize the resources consumed by the animation, you can signal the browser that an animation is about to take place with the `will-change` instruction. To find out more: [https://web.dev/animations-guide/](https://web.dev/animations-guide/)

You can also give your users the choice, via their browser preferences and the media query preferences-reduced-motion, of allowing the animation to be played or not. The animation is only played if the user has not defined a preference.

## Example

```css
.box {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```
