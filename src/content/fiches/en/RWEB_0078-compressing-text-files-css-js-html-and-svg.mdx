## Description

To limit bandwidth usage and improve loading times, compress text files: CSS, JS, HTML and SVG. The algorithm allows resources to be compressed on the fly before being sent to clients.

More recently, `BROTLI` has been popularized with enhanced performance. It is supported by all popular browsers.

## Example

To use `BROTLI` in NGinx, simply add the following configuration : 

```
# for compressing responses on - the - fly
load_module modules / ngx_http_brotli_filter_module.so;
# for serving pre - compressed files
load_module modules / ngx_http_brotli_static_module.so;
http {
      server {
      brotli on;
      #...
      }
}
```
