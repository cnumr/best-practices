## Description

When designing a digital service, it's essential to define the media required for each user. A responsive website can be quite sufficient and satisfactory.

However, if a mobile application is strictly necessary, and takes over all or part of the website, then a PWA (Progressive Web App) is a solution that avoids the double or even triple development and maintenance that would be involved in developing a native or hybrid mobile application (native React, Flutter).

As a PWA is not tied to an operating system (OS), and is often lighter than a native mobile application, it reduces the risk of mobile terminal obsolescence and lower bandwidth usage. This is why several social networks have developed a PWA to conquer the African market.

## Exemple

* E-commerce sites (Lancôme, Starbucks, etc.)
* Media (L'équipe, Courrier International, Forbes, etc.)
* Software as a Service (Microsoft 365, Gmail, etc.)
* Social networks (Twitter Lite, Telegram, etc.)
* Business applications (SNCF, etc.)
