### Description

Automatic videos and audio files activation (autoplay) during web pages loading uses resources on each tier (device, network, data center). In many cases, automatic playback is not necessary. Moreover, it can draw users' attention and distract them from the initially requested service. Therefore, whenever possible, these playbacks should be initiated by the users and by not using the autoplay attributes in the `<video>` or `<audio>` tags.

Nevertheless, some parts of the video or audio files may be downloaded even if autoplay is not activated. Moreover, data will be unnecessarily downloaded even if users do not start the video playback. It is therefore necessary to force browsers not to preload anything by setting the preload attribute to none on the \<video> ou \<audio> tags.

### Example

Video:

```html
<video src="audiofile.webm" preload="none"></video>
```

Audio:

```html
<audio controls src="audiofile.mp3" preload="none"></audio>
```
