## Description

The main social networks such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Pinterest, etc. provide plug-ins that can be installed on a web page to display a ‘Share’ button or a ‘Like’ counter. These JavaScript libraries are often heavy to download and generate a lot of requests. Direct HTML links to sharing pages are preferable. These links can be generated by hand (see below) or using a tool such as Share Link Generator ([https://www.sharelinkgenerator.com](https://www.sharelinkgenerator.com)). This good practice is not limited to social networks!

## Example

A button can be added to open a sharing pop-up in the same way as the official buttons, for example with the following code:

```html
<button type = "button" onclick = "window.open('https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=XXXXX', '', 'menubar = no, toolbar = no, resizable = yes, scrollbars = yes, height = 500, width = 700')">
    Share this page on Facebook
</button>
```
