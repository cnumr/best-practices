## Description

JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and ready-to-use CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, skeleton, gumby, foundation, etc.) are excellent tools used to create websites very quickly, as they almost meet all the most common requirements.

The downside is that only a small part of those libraries is generally used; and some of these frameworks and libraries do not rely on a modular architecture, making users download entire libraries only to use a small percentage of their features.

Avoid using these libraries when possible (see [https://youmightnotneedjquery.com)](https://youmightnotneedjquery.com\)) or only keep their most used parts (see https\://getbootstrap.com/customize).

Bundlers like Webpack allow the automatic removal of unused code. This is called tree shaking.

## Exemple

Some frameworks (here Bootstrap) allow you to create custom libraries that only contain the parts actually used by the site, thus reducing libraries size and resources used during execution.
