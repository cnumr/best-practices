### Description

When several properties of a DOM (Document Object Model) element need to be modified, each content or style change will trigger repaints and / or reflows.

It is usually preferable to:

* Hide these elements (set display property to none) (1 reﬂow);
* Modify all properties and make the elements visible again (1 reﬂow).

That is, maximum 2 reﬂows.

### Example

Proceed as follows:

```javascript
var elem = document.getElementById('foo'); elem.style.display = 'none'; // Generate 1 reﬂow elem.style.width ='10em';
elem.style.height = 'auto';
// ... other changes ...
elem.style.display = 'block'; // Generate 1 reﬂow
```

Only 2 reflows are required (instead of potentially 6 or 7).
