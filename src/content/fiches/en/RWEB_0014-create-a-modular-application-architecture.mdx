## Description

The modular architecture (popularized by open-source software) often brings a greater scalability, reduces maintenance costs and a more efficient code.

If the functional coverage of the website or web service can evolve, it is interesting to implement the basic features in a core application than can be extended with plugins. Those plugins can be developed independently and shared between applications.

This approach can be used at all levels, for a custom solution, or for the choice of an HTTP server or a CMS..

## Example

Popular open-source software, largely used on the web like NGINX, Apache, MySQL or PHP, use a modular architecture.

The microservice architecture allow some level of modularity, but be careful on how the concerns are spread among the
components and how they interact: added complexity, network calls, and other unintended negative consequences can
increase resources consumption.
