## Description

Redirects slow response time while using unnecessary resources. Therefore, they should be avoided as much as possible. Redirects can occur at different places: HTML code, JavaScript code, HTTP server, and application server (PHP, etc.).

## Exemple

On the HTTP server level (Apache, in this case), redirects involve activating systematic URL rewriting via the .htaccess file:

```apache
<IfModule mod_alias.c>
    Redirect permanent http://ancienne_adresse.fr http://nouvelle.adresse.fr/
</IfModule>
```

It is preferable to manually replace static addresses embedded in web pages.
