### Description

Tools used to track users' actions often use a lot of client-side resources: large number of requests, additional JavaScript files, multiple additional domains, cookies, etc.

If tracking information is not essential, do not use it. Otherwise, try to use a single tool and choose a solution that requires fewer resources.
