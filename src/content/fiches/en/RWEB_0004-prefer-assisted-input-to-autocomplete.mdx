## Description

Autocomplete suggests matching results as the user types. For each character typed, a request is sent to the server to retrieve the appropriate results. This can be costly in resources.

Assisted input is preferable, as it provides the user with a set of locally-managed information and hints, reducing the number of exchanges with the server.

Reduce the impact of autocompletion with simple optimizations: delay of a few tenths of a second between the addition of a character and the query, launch the query only after a certain number of characters have been typed, limit the number of results displayed, etc.

To reduce the amount of back-and-forth, if the data proposed to the user is small in quantity, you can include it directly in your HTML code and use the native \<datalist> element.

## Example

The \<datalist> element, a single back and forth with the server.

```html
<label for="ice-cream-choice">Choose a flavor:</label>
<input list="ice-cream-flavors" id="ice-cream-choice" name="ice-cream-choice" />

<datalist id="ice-cream-flavors">
  <option value="Chocolate"></option>
  <option value="Coconut"></option>
  <option value="Mint"></option>
  <option value="Strawberry"></option>
  <option value="Vanilla"></option>
</datalist>
```
