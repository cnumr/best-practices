## Description

Use the electricity source having the lowest environmental impact as possible during its production (e.g. hydraulic) to power your digital equipment.

Note that to this day there is no reliable way to ensure that the electricity has been produced with the lowest impact.
As an alternative, you can either choose a provider that does not purchase any electricity produced from fossil fuels or buy EACs (Energy Attribute Certificate).

## Exemple

Although restricted  greenhouse gas emissions, [https://app.electricitymap.org/map](https://app.electricitymap.org/map) allows you to be informed about the carbon intensity of the supplier's country's electricity.\
\
The site [https://calculator.green-algorithms.org](https://calculator.green-algorithms.org) allows you to estimate GHG emissions based on the location of your service as well the used physical resources in order to make the best decision.
