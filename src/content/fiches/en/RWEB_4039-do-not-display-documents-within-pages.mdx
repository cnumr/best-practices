### Description

Some content creators sometimes feel the need to directly integrate documents into pages in order to view them directly. This is an unwelcome feature since it requires specific development. Moreover, the file is downloaded to be displayed each time the page is opened.

### Example

For example, a word processing file will need to call up suitable software to be displayed. However, this file cannot be read without important specific development if the requested software is not directly installed on users computers. It is rather preferred to insert document download links within the web page so that users can choose to download it when they want to.
