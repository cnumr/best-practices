## Description

Database management systems are designed and optimized for efficient processing of large quantities of data. In the case of processing with more or less complex logic, you should carry it out as close as possible to the data in order to:

* limit bandwidth due to the transfer of unprocessed data;
* take advantage of database optimizations for data manipulation;
* lighten the CPU cycle on the backend or frontend server side.

## Exemple

In the case of complex queries with large amounts of data, and when using a relational database management system (RDBMS), it is advisable to use stored procedures, as:

* a stored procedure saves the server the trouble of interpreting the query, as it is pre-compiled;
* a stored procedure is less bandwidth-intensive, as less information is exchanged between server and client.

All recent RDBMS (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) support stored procedures.
