## Description

When AllowOverride directive is enabled, Apache HTTP server must go up the entire directory hierarchy to possibly find an .htaccess file containing override rules. Disabling this directive if possible in the Apache configuration is recommended.

## Exemple

In your Apache host configuration file, add:

```
AllowOverride none
```
