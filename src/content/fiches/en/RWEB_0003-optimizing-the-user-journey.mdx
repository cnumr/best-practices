## Description

Optimizing the user journey means reducing the time spent by users on their most frequent uses. To begin with, this means targeting the most frequent journeys, then optimizing their use: reduce the number of steps and actions, eliminate unnecessary ones, identify cases of failure, display clear and simple messages and indications in case of error, optimize response times... A journey is well designed when the program behaves exactly as the user imagined it would.

At the very least, surveying the people around you who use the service is a good way of identifying friction points - situations or interactions that contribute to degrading the user experience and slowing down the user journey. User testing allows us to go deeper into these friction points.

The time spent by the user on his or her terminal is the second largest environmental impact.

## Example

* Propose a new order for a website, based on the content of the previous order.
* Buy without registering on an e-commerce site.
* Copy and paste your bank account details directly rather than downloading and transferring them.
* Highlight the most frequently used fields or filters.
