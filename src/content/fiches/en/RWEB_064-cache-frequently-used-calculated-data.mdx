## Description

When value or data calculations are resource-intensive, it is advisable to cache them if the values remain unchanged, so as not to repeat these operations.

Key-value store cache systems are designed to store such data. Generally installed entirely in random access memory (RAM), they generate considerable savings in CPU cycles if the calculated data is very frequently requested.

## Exemple

The number of contents (e.g. products) belonging to a category is calculated even though it is not updated very frequently. Caching the number of items in each category saves CPU cycles. OAuth2 access tokens have an expiry date. Caching the token and its expiry date avoids unnecessary calls to the authorization server and the need to revalidate the token.
