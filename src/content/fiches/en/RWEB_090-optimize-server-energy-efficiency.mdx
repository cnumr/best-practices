## Description

It is possible to reduce servers power consumption by selecting energy-efficient equipments that provides the same service.

## Exemple

When purchasing servers, choose ones which power supplies meet the 80Plus eco-label (Platinum and Titanium levels). 

Also choose servers that are Energy Star labelled.

It is also possible to choose hardware architecture that suits the web application type. For example, physicalization is more suitable for a high-traffic website: using "n" very low-power CPUs instead of "n" virtual machines running on a physical server whose processor (Xeon, etc.) is often energy-intensive.
