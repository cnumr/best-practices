## Description

With widespread support on all browsers for key-value databases (IndexDB, Web Storage), and caching via the Cache Storage API, it is now possible to store structured static data locally.

The benefits of local storage are twofold. Firstly, it avoids unnecessary round-trips with the server, which saves resources and response time. Secondly, because the data is local, it is easier and quicker to manipulate it directly on the user's device.

The potential gain is a reduction in the server load, and therefore in the amount of equipment needed (and its environmental and economic footprint), from HTTP servers to database servers.

## Example

For example, to store the user's name, you can use the following instruction:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('name', 'user_name');
```

You can then use the following line to find it later:

```javascript
var myName = localStorage.getItem('name');
```
