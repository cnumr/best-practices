## Description

As the choice of technology is crucial to reducing resource consumption, select the most economical tool according to your business needs and constraints.

For a site whose content changes little, a static site is preferable, which can be cached and does not require an application server or database. For a more dynamic site, bespoke solutions offer greater flexibility in terms of technical optimisation and allow you to include only what is strictly necessary to meet your business needs. If part of a website is based on a very limited number of pages and delivers a specific service (order tunnel, quote request), the use of a SPA (Single Page Application) may be recommended. This limits the number of round trips to the server and makes the user experience more fluid.

## Example

For a corporate site containing only a presentation of the company and a contact form, static web pages are preferable, given the infrequency with which they are updated.
