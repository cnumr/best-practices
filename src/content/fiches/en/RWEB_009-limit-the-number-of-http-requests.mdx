## Description

The loading time of a page in the browser is correlated to the number of files that must be downloaded and to the size of these files.

Depending on the server type, the number of requests can limit the number of pages that be served to the users. Decreasing the number of requests by page allows the reduction of the number of HTTP servers, and maybe of other components of the architecture, like databases and application servers.

Although the issue is much less potent with the use of HTTP 2, having a lot of requests can significantly impact the performance of the application of the client side. In any case, having too many requests is a good sign that some improvements can be performed on the application.

## Exemple

Using a CSS sprite sheet (i.e., grouping all the small images in one bigger picture, then selecting the displayed one on the client side with CSS) to display the small flags in a language picker reduces the number of requests associated with  this feature.
