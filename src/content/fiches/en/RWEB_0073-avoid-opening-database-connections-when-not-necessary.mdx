## Description

Whatever the database system, opening a connection is a resource-intensive process for both client and server:

* memory allocation and disk access for buffers;
* network round-trips for the connection protocol;
* induced CPU cost.

The best practice usually used is to set up a connection pool. This optimizes connection management and performance. However, configuring it is not necessarily a trivial operation (it requires monitoring its behavior to find the right settings). That said, whenever the application can avoid database access, do it!

## Exemple

HikariCP is a robust and performant JDBC connection pool. It is integrated into SpringBoot.

When there is no connection pool, reuse a connection and do not open/close a new connection for each request.
