### Description

Use CSS properties instead of images. Style sheets are much smaller, especially when they are compressed. Calling for a stylesheet only generates a single HTTP request while using many images generates many HTTP requests (one HTTP request for each image).

### Example

Rounded corners of elements should be implemented with CSS rather than images.

Prefer writing:

```css
#frame {
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

```html
<div id="frame">
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
  </p>
</div>
```
