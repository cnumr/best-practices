## Description

Server logs (web, application, database) can become very large. It is recommended to configure them. By adjusting the application's log level at the highest possible level (e.g. only information/warning/error) and by logging only relevant information, disk writes are avoided, the number of CPU cycles is reduced as well as storage space use.

To avoid disk saturation, it is also recommended to set up a retention time and log rotation based on the service operational needs.

## Exemple

The access logs of an Apache server can be configured as follows to exclude static resources and RSS feeds:

SetEnvIf Request\_URI "\\.(ico|pdf|ï¬‚v|jpg|jpeg|png|gif| js|css|gz|swf|txt)$" dontlog
SetEnvIf Request\_URI "^/rss/" dontlog
CustomLog /var/log/apache/access.log combined env=!dontlog
