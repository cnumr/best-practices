## Description

The size of the image sent to the browser should be as close as possible to that of the display size.

In modern integrations, with responsive images, it's important to define the `srcset` or `source` attributes so that each device type uses a version of the image adapted to its screen size and resolution.

Note: The `height` and `width` attributes generally allow you to define the smallest display ratio, but CSS is currently the main driver for determining display sizes based on screen sizes.

Compare the number of pixels in the uploaded image to the number of pixels actually displayed.

The yellowlab.tools tool can help you with this.

## Exemple

A 350 × 300 pixel image encoded in PNG 24 weighs 41 KB. The same image displayed as a thumbnail at 70 × 60 pixels still weighs 41 KB, although it shouldn't exceed 3 KB!

Example of responsive syntax:

HTML:

```html
<img id="monimage" src="image_3ko.png" width="70" height="60"
 srcset="image_3ko.png 640w, image_41ko.png 1920w">
```

CSS : 

```javascript
#monimage { width: 70px; height: 60px }
@media(min - width: 640px) {
      #monimage { width: 350px; height: 300px }
}
```
