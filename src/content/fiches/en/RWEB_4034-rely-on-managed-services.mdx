## Description

Cloud platforms are specialized in setting up resilient, scalable, efficient, secure, and shared infrastructures. They offer managed services based on these infrastructures such as:

* Multimedia content storage
* Data persistence via reference databases (e.g., Postgresql)
* Storage and messaging services (e.g., Kafka)
* Containers management (e.g., Kubernetes)

It is preferable to use these managed services unless there is a strong expertise in the team.

It will generally be very difficult to achieve better efficiency than the provider's implementation with a custom setup.\


## Exemple

Hosting providers now offer "serverless computing," a paradigm in which resources allocated to the service are dynamically managed.

This allows service teams to worry less about infrastructure and allows the host to optimize resource allocation.
