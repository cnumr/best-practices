## Description

Ajax responses that will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future do not need to be requested from the server again. It is therefore worth caching them to save bandwidth.

## Example

If an Ajax request returns a list of city names, contact names or any or any other non-calculated element, these responses should be cached cached on the client (browser) side so as not to generate another request to the server.
