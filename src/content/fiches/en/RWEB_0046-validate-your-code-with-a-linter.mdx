### Description

ESLint code quality analyzer checks that the JavaScript syntax will be understood by all browsers. The resulting code respects syntax constraints that make it easier and faster for interpreters to execute the code. Processor will therefore be solicited for a shorter time.

In modern development, adding different tools to your delivery process to ensure the quality of your code is recommended.

### Example

We can use, for example:

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript code
* [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) for your stylesheets
