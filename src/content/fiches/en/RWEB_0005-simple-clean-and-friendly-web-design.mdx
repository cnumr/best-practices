## Description

Any interface or web design must be carefully considered in advance, taking into account the following points to achieve a Green/Sustainable UX :

* the user needs (see “Optimizing the user journey”, page 50) ;
* the usability heuristics (Bastien et Scapin, Nielsen, etc.) ;
* the technical constraints ;
* the sustainable design best practices ;
* the accessibility best practices.\


Keep the design simple and clean, limiting the number of graphical elements and using only HTML5 and CSS3.

## Example

Some sites contain images that are framed, non-contrasting and non-readable (RGAA), creating unnecessary mental overload (2.2. Scapin and Bastien's Information Density). When downloaded, these images are not visible on cell phones (sustainable design). The incoherence between signs and colorimetry can sometimes be raised (1.2.2. Grouping/Distinction by format from Scapin et Bastien).
