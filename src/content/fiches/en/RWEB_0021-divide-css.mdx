### Description

Use a set of CSS instead of a single one, and only import the necessary ones according to the context. This method helps to limit the page size, therefore saving bandwidth and reducing CPU load.

### Example

Use a functional logic to divide the CSS :

* layout;
* content;
* module x;
* module y;
* etc...

This will exclude all CSS from unused modules in the case of a feature-rich website. The number of CSS files must remain reasonable, more for maintainability purposes than performance issues, as general CSS (“layout” and “content” in our example) will be concatenated into a single file.

Optional CSS files (here "module x" and "module y") will be downloaded depending on the context (page, functionalities...).
