## Description

If the application server or CMS offers a multi-level cache system, use these different levels, as their granularity reduces the resources consumed (CPU cycles, memory). In this way, you deliver good performance to the user while consuming fewer resources on the server side.

## Example

WordPress offers various cache management extensions: LiteSpeed Cache, WP Fastest Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache. 

Pages are cached on the server and no longer generated for each user. Incidentally, this kind of tool also provides other WebPerf-oriented optimizations in the direction of web eco-design.

It's also a good idea to enable caching of SQL queries in order to relieve the load on the database.
