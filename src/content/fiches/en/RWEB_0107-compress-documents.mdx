### Description

Compress all documents that can be downloaded from a web page, unless compression doesn't bring much benefit (for example: web optimized PDF files).

### Example

A DOC file weighing 7.8 MB will decrease to 5.5 MB after compression, which represents a 30% gain (default WinZip compression). Office files formats that can be easily compressed include:

* Text documents (.doc, .docx, .rtf, .txt, etc.);
* Spreadsheets (.xls, .xslx, etc.);
* Presentations (.ppt, .pptx, etc.);
* PDF documents;
* Multimedia content (images, audio, and video).
