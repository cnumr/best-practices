## Description

The page title \<h1>, and its equivalent \<title>, together with a relevant \<meta name="description"> tag, must be perfectly in line with the content of the associated page.\
This optimization matches the user's search criteria, avoiding unnecessary visits (going back and forth to find the information they're looking for). It also reduces the user's time spent in search engines.\
Paying close attention to the quality of `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` elements also helps :

* to correctly index content pages for search engines and directories;
* to ensure identification of the site and the content of the landing page;
* to guarantee understanding before accessing the content;
* to validate the content or information requested within the associated page.

## Example

In the case of an online sportswear shop, the page presenting the tracksuits will have a \<title> of the type “ShopName > Clothing > sports > tracksuits” and a description in the \<meta name="description"> tag of the type “Buy our tracksuits online at the lowest price”.
