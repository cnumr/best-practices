## Description

A circuit breaker is a design pattern for optimizing calls to a service (typically an API) when it's not responding.

Depending on a number of criteria (timeout, number of errors), the calling service detects the problem and, instead of forwarding requests to the remote service indiscriminately, can replace the call with a predefined behavior such as using a default value or calling another service. In all cases, the circuit breaker allows  to define a policy of retries : every x seconds, for example.

This practice saves resources (network calls) both for the caller (there's no point in calling a service that fails) and for the callee, who can then recover more easily.

## Example

On e-commerce websites, some product information can be provided by dedicated services.


When the main service that provide product page "learns" that the detailed information service encounters errors,
it stops calling it, avoiding unnecessarily failed calls, leaving room for the external service to go back up and saving resources on both sides.


The e-commerce service remains operational even though experience is degraded.
