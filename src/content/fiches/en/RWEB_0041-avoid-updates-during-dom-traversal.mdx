### Description

Updating DOM (Document Object Model) elements while navigating through it can result in situations leading to greedy resource consumption, especially CPU cycles. Adding elements during DOM traversal might end up creating an infinite loop which will consume a large amount of resources. This kind of modification should be avoided when possible.

### Example

Avoid:

```html
<script>
  // jQuery notation
  $('a.extlink').each(function(el) {
    $(el).attr('rel', 'external nofollow');
     });
</script>
```

Write:

```html
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    var itemsToUpdate = [];
  $('a.extlink').each(function() {
    itemsToUpdate.push(this);
    });
  $(itemsToUpdate).attr('rel', 'external nofollow');
});
</script>
```

This code stores DOM elements to update in a temporary variable and then executes them in one operation.
