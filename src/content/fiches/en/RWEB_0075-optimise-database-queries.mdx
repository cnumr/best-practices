## Description

The requests made to retrieve and save data have a significant impact on resource consumption and must therefore be optimised. There are a number of classic ways of optimising them:

* Bringing back less data and limiting it to what is necessary.
* Select only the fields you need.
* Add indexes to fields used as keys. This can drastically reduce the power required for the query.
* Analyse queries to identify areas for improvement, for example using EXPLAIN for an RDBMS.
* Cache the results of the most expensive and most frequent queries.
* Possibly denormalise the data model to avoid joins, which can slow down queries.

## Example

If you only want to display the first 25 records in a table containing people's first and last names, replace:

```sql
SELECT prenom, nom FROM personnes
```

by:

```sql
SELECT prenom, nom FROM personnes LIMIT 0, 25
```
