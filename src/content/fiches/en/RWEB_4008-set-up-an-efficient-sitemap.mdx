## Description

Sitemaps help facilitating websites pages and content indexation by search engines. Outdated sitemaps may contain irrelevant URL, referring to rarely visited and not very useful pages or content. Such situations may result in wrong redirections sending users to uninteresting web pages or even orphan pages via search engines meaning that users might waste computing resources.
