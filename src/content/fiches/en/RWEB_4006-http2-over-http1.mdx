## Description

The HTTP/1 protocol loads resources sequentially. If a resource is large or cannot be loaded, it blocks the loading of subsequent resources, giving the user the impression of slowness.

HTTP/2 is more efficient than HTTP/1, as it is a binary protocol (fewer bytes are transmitted), and also allows :

\- **multiplexing**: send all resources at once using a single TCP connection;

\- **prioritization**: the developer can specify the order in which resources are to be loaded (thus prioritizing the display of resources that are essential to the page);

\- **HPACK compression**: an advanced compression method that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets;

\- **server push**: allowing a server to “push” content to a client before the client requests it (be careful not to abuse this feature).

## Example

HTTP/2 targets a 50% reduction in page load time (PLT).
