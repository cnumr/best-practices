      possible

### Description

Use selectors based on IDs or classes as they will be filtered more quickly, thus saving CPU cycles on the associated device.

### Example

Do not write :

```css
treeitem[mailfolder = "true"] > treerow > treecell { … }
```

instead write :

```css
.treecell-mailfolder { … }
```

Do not write :

```css
treehead > treerow > treecell { … }
```

instead write :

```css
.treecell-header { … }
```
