## Description

Use a framework or custom development to benefit from greater freedom in optimizing certain processes.

CMS are more restrictive, and require more resources to achieve their main objective: flexibility. What's more, using too many extensions can consume a lot of resources and slow down the site.

However, a very light, modular CMS such as a static site generator (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Eleventy, etc.) administered by a decoupled or flat-file CMS (Strapi, Contentful, Flex-type, etc.) can save development time.

## Example

In the case of a showcase site whose information is rarely updated, opt for a static website while allowing a few man-days for updating. If a feature requires user interaction, opt for customized development.
