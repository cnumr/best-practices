## Description

Most of the time, the end of life of a digital service is not anticipated.

An end-of-life plan can take the form of a document that includes all resources to be decommissioned, deleted, or backed up: servers, storage, middlewares, configurations, source code, documentation, etc.

Don't forget development resources and medias such as messaging channels, continuous integration jobs, and, of course, test environments.

Skills acquired on the project should be shared whenever possible.

## Example

If a site for a past event (e.g., an exhibition) is shut down, it is important to list all associated resources: databases, application servers, configurations (e.g., URL redirects), documentation, multimedia files, etc., and ensure that everything is properly decommissioned and archived.
