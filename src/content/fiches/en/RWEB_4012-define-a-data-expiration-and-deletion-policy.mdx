## Description

Define a retention period for each stored item of data, to enable it to be deleted or archived via a process (batch, database time-to-live, etc.). Many RDBMSs enable automatic and definitive deletion via a TTL (Time To Live) on a table or piece of data.

What's more, since the implementation of the RGPD, it has been mandatory to delete a user's personal data after a certain period of time, which goes in the direction of eco-design.

## Example

Here, on an Oracle Java database, the data expires after 5 days:

```java
String aKey = «myFirstKey»;
String aData = «myFirstData»;
try {
    DatabaseEntry theKey = new DatabaseEntry(aKey.getBytes("UTF-8"));
    DatabaseEntry theData = new DatabaseEntry(aData.getBytes("UTF-8"));
    WriteOptions wo = new WriteOptions();
    wo.setTTL(5);
    myDatabase.put(null,
                    theKey,
                    theData,
                    Put.NO_OVERWRITE,
                    wo);
} catch (Exception e) {
}
```
