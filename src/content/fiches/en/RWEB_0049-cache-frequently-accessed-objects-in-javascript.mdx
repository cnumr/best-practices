## Description

Accessing the DOM (Document Object Model) uses a lot of processor resources (CPU cycles).

Therefore, when using the same DOM element several times in JavaScript, you should store its reference in a variable so that you don't need to go through the DOM again for that same element.

## Exemple

Do not write :

```javascript
document.getElementById('menu').property1 = 'foo';
document.getElementById('menu').property2 = 'bar';
```

write instead :

```javascript
const menu = document.getElementById('menu');
menu.property1 = 'foo';
menu.property2 = 'bar'
```
