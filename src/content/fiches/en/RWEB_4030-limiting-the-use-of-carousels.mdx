## Description

The carousel, used to highlight multiple content items, quickly shows its limits in terms of conversion, with a negative impact on the user experience. Its use implies several critical points:

* the weight of the pages is increased by the presence of dedicated CSS and JavaScript, but also by the content present on each screen of the carousel;
* a complexity in terms of web quality and accessibility;
* a greater use of processor resources in the case of an automatic, looped carousel.\\

The best practice is to limit the use of carousels as much as possible, giving priority to regularly updated static content. Otherwise :

* set up a simple and complete component control (stop, next/previous screen);
* prefer progressive loading.

## Example

Animation of some CSS attributes requires browsers to repaint/reflow, which requires processor resources. To limit this, prefer to animate carousels using the CSS transform property.
