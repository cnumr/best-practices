## Description

Accessing the DOM (Document Object Model) via JavaScript is a heavy task that uses a lot of CPU cycles. Avoid these accesses as much as possible.

To do this, you can assign the node to variables that you will reuse during the application's life cycle. 
It avoids re-traversing the tree again each time you manipulate the document.

It is also possible to use “Shadow DOM” type libraries, which optimize tree modifications with a batch system.

## Exemple

To learn more, you can consult the W3C Shadow DOM project:
https\://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/ 
and the W3C recommendations to reduce access to the DOM via JavaScript:
