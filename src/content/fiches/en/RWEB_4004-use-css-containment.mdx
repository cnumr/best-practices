### Description

CSS containment indicates that a node and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the page tree.

Depending on the independence type (strict, content, size, layout, styleand/or paint) set by the containproperty, browsers:

* recalculate renderings (positions, formatting, layouts, and/or display) for the independent node only, saving the need to recompute for the entire page
* do not render independent nodes content outside the visible area

### Examples

* A complex DOM architecture whose NODE content is modified at some point

```css
article {
  contain: content;
}
```

* External widget

```css
.widget - name {
  contain: layout;
}
```
