## Description

Open source software are often forked (derived) for performance reasons. Improved performance generally means a reduction in resource consumption. Consequently, if an optimised fork exists and offers a sufficient functional and technical scope for a project, it makes sense to use it.

## Example

Instead of Redis, prefer the optimised KeyDB version.
