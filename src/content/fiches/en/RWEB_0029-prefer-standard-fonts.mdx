### Description

Use standard fonts that are already installed on the user's computer and do not need any additional downloads to save bandwidth and accelerate web pages loading. You can find a list of standard fonts at [https://systemfontstack.com/](https://systemfontstack.com/).

If however you need a specific font for your digital service, even if it is an API font (Google font, Adobe font, etc.), you must:

* Host the font by yourself
* Use faux-bold via the -webkit-text-strokeCSS property when possible
* Prefer the use of variable fonts if you need more than one variant (ex: regular, bold, etc.)
* Optimize the font by removing unnecessary characters (example: French sites only require latin characters, cyrillic alphabet can therefore be deleted). This can be achieved with [https://www.glyphrstudio.com/](https://www.glyphrstudio.com/).

You should incorporate new glyphs directly into fonts if you have monochrome pictograms or illustrations (see rule 30: Prefer glyphs to images) and font usage rights allow it.

### Example

Here is a comparison chart of Oswald typeface font sizes:

|        | Regular | Regular + Bold | Variable | Regular Latin | Latin Regular + Latin Bold | Variable Latin |
| ------ | ------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| Weight | 37.6kb  | 76.9kb         | 66kb     | 16kb          | 32.5kb                     | ?              |

### Alternative solution

Users can choose, through browser settings, to ask websites they visit to optimize the network requests. You can detect it with the prefers-reduced-datamedia query.

In the example below, Montserratfont will only be downloaded if users didn't set any personal settings. Otherwise, the Arialfont will be used and Montserratwill not be downloaded.

```javascript
@media(prefers - reduced - data: no - preference) {
  @font-face {
    font - family: Montserrat;
    font - style: normal;
    font - weight: 400;
    src: url('fonts/montserrat-latin-regular.woff2');
  }
}

bodysuit {
  font - family: Montserrat, Arial;
}
```
