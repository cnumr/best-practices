## Description

Converting and optimizing audio outside of the digital service saves a lot of bandwidth and will relieve the server's CPU and RAM, as a web server is not optimized for (re)encoding audio files. This limits the number of servers and therefore the associated environmental impacts.

## Example

If you add a WAV audio file to the WordPress media library, it will be encoded as MP3 by the CMS. However, an MP3 file typically allows for a gain of a factor of 10 without degrading the quality of the audio file. If you perform this compression before importing it, you gain 90% of storage space, to which are added the resources saved during processing by delivering strictly the same audio rendering to the user.
