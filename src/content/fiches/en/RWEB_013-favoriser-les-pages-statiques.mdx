## Description

If a page is updated very infrequently, static pages built outside the CMS are preferable. This saves CPU cycles and bandwidth.

Using a dynamic content management system requires loading the various software layers needed to serve the content requested by the surfer: the HTTP server, the application server, the content storage system (database), any associated caching systems, etc. A static file, on the other hand, is directly loaded into the CMS. A static file, on the other hand, is directly read and sent back to the user by the HTTP server or cache server, without calling on the application server or database.

## Exemple

Depending on the digital service to be designed, you might consider:

* for a landing page or simple showcase site, creating a static site in HTML, CSS and JS;
* for a blog with little activity or of small size, creating a static site generated via a jamstack (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Eleventy, etc. ) administered, if necessary, via a headless CMS or a headless flat-file CMS (Strapi, Contentful, Flextype, Cecil.app, etc.);
* for a more complex site or web application, make low-modification pages (FAQ, About, Legal Notice, etc.) static using suitable frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt.js, Svelte, etc.).
