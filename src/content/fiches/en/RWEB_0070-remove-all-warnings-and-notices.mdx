## Description

Warnings and notices slow down application servers such as PHP as they have to trace the errors origins and record messages explaining the associated problems in various logs systems.

## Exemple

Avoid :

```html
<form method="post">
  <input type="text" name="name"
         value="<?= htmlentities($_POST['name']) ?>">
</form>
```

`$_POST['Ô¨Årst_name']` and `$_POST['last_name']` generate notices because they are not necessarily defined.
