## Description

Some web services allow you to manage administrative procedures, open contracts, make claims, etc., without having to go anywhere. Many of these procedures can be complex to manage, or may not take special cases into account.\
As an example, to validate a connection to an online banking service, installation of a mobile application, and so ownership of a smartphone, may be required. Some users may be unable to use the service at all.\
Setting up a lower-tech alternative (phone call, SMS, physical reception point) can compensate for this situation.

## Example

For complex administrative procedures such as taking out an insurance policy, provide a customer service hotline number to help users deal with any obstacles.
