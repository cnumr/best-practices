### Description

Make sure that PDF files are truly optimized for the web before uploading them: image sampling rate and compression, embedded fonts, resolution, etc. If necessary, allow users to download PDF as individual chapters.

If you want to offer the users the ability to download a PDF reader, prefer lightweight software such as Sumatra (4.3 MB) over Adobe reader (48 MB), it will reduce bandwidth usage by a factor of 10 for each download and, most importantly, it will result in lower memory usage (which helps fight digital divide and planned obsolescence).

### Example

In the case of an annual report in PDF format:

* check that images are heavily compressed and have a maximum resolution of 72 dpi;
* only include main fonts;
* divide the report into chapters to limit unnecessary downloads.
