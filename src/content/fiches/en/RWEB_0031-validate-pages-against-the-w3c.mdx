## Description

A well-formed HTML code ensures better accessibility, better referencing and, above all, improved performance. If this is not the case, the browser will dynamically correct a certain number of elements to display the pages with problems in the best possible way. These dynamic corrections unnecessarily consume resources each time the concerned pages are loaded.

## Example

Use the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) validator to check that the pages are valid and that the HTML code is correctly formed: [https://validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org) or [https://validator.w3.org/nu/](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) to filter out errors.
