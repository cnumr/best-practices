      images, iframes, and videos called without a lazy loading attribute and
      below the initial viewport is
    maxValue: '0'
---

## Description

By default, all resources (images, videos, iframes, etc.) of a web page are downloaded, even when users do not display them, for instance if they are outside the viewport. To avoid this, the lazy loading technique can be used: elements with this attribute will be loaded only when they become visible on the screen.

It is possible to add a \`loading\` attribute to images and iframes in HTML so that the browser will only download images  that are displayed on the screen. However, this attribute is very recent: it will not work on older browser versions. 

For the sake of improved compatibility, it is still possible to use very light Javascript mini-libraries which can handle 

images lazy-loading, such as:

* LOZAD https\://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lozad 1.9 KB (gzip)
* vanilla-lazyload https\://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-lazyload/dist/lazyload.min.js 3.5 KB (gzip)

## Exemple

In this example, the image and iframe will be automatically lazy-loaded by the browser. If an image must be displayed on

the screen, it will be downloaded and displayed. Otherwise, it will not be downloaded.

\<img src="image.jpg" alt="..." loading="lazy">

\<iframe src="video-player.html" title="..." loading="lazy">\</iframe>
