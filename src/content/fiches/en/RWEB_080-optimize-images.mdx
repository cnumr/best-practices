## Description

Reducing image size starts with choosing the appropriate format. Reserve raster images for photos and interface elements that cannot be supported by icons or CSS styles.

The choice depends on the image's characteristics. The ability to permanently degrade the image (lossy) tends to favor JPEG, JPEG XL, AVIF, or WEBP formats, while a need for transparency and/or the inability to degrade the image (lossless) tends to favor a lossless PNG or WEBP format.

On average, a .webp image is 30% lighter than a .jpg or .png image but 20% heavier than an .avif image.

Some server-side modules (such as Google's *modPageSpeed*, available for *Apache* and *Nginx*) even provide the ideal image for the browser calling the server.

## Exemple

The `<picture>` element in the DOM tells the browser that there are two images: a .webp image and a .jpg image, the default. The browser will decide which ine to download:

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="..." loading="lazy">
</picture>
```
