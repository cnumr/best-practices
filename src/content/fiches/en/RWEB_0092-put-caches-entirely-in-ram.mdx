## Description

Wherever possible, cache systems should be mounted memory (RAM), which is much faster in terms of read/write access read/write access than hard disk storage (SSD or mechanical).

This avoids :

\- input/output on storage media,

\- CPU cycles.

## Example

Examples of Drupal RAM cache integration:

\- Memcache integration: https\://drupal.org/project/memcache;

\- Varnish integration: https\://drupal.org/project/varnish.

PHP has its own shared memory cache system called APCu: https\://www\.php.net/manual/fr/book.apcu.php.
