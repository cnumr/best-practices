### Description

Taking care of your website regularly is essential not only to ensure that it is working properly and improve user experience but also to reduce its environmental footprint. Over time, websites accumulate content and features, increasing the risk of displaying and storing unnecessary, obsolete, or counterproductive information. This will result in problems on several levels as it can:

- cause website poor ranking;
- alter the reputation of your product;
- slow downloading time and degrade user experience;
- loose visitors by displaying irrelevant/obsolete information;
- unnecessarily consume resources needed to store unused data;
- create incompatibilities with other tools that are installed on the website;
- cause website to be targeted by cyberattacks.

### Example

When using a CMS:

- update the CMS and its extensions to reduce security issues.
