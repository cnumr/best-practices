### Description

Several studies (Cast Software and Standish Group, in particular) show that 70% of the functionalities requested by 
the users are not essential and that 45% are never used. By reducing the coverage and functional depth of the 
application, we lower its initial development cost, its technical debt and the associated environmental impacts.

This reduces the infrastructure needed to run it. Moreover, at a constant ergonomic level, the poorer the application is in terms of functionality, the easier it will be to use. Therefore, it is interesting to reduce the functional coverage of the application as much as possible, by focusing it on essential users’ needs.

Detecting a non-essential functionality is possible when analyzing the expression of the need. The MoSCoW method, workshops,
wireframes or prototypes with user tests make it possible to verify the usefulness of a feature prior to its development.

### Examples

Several successful products of the digital world – Google, Twitter, WhatsApp, Pinterest, Instagram, etc. – provide a 
single service and rely on great functional sobriety.

When analyzing the expression of the need, ask yourself the question: "What happens if we don't have it?" ".

Respect the YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle of extreme programming: develop when you actually need a feature,
not when you imagine you need it.
