### Description

Cloud platforms are specialized in setting up resilient, scalable, efficient, secure, and shared infrastructures. They offer managed services based on these infrastructures such as:

- Multimedia content storage
- Data persistence via reference databases (e.g., Postgresql)
- Storage and messaging services (e.g., Kafka)
- Containers management (e.g., Kubernetes)

It is preferable to use these managed services unless there is a strong expertise in the team.
It will generally be very difficult to achieve better efficiency than the provider's implementation with a custom setup.
