### Description

Most environments (POC - proof of concept, testing, acceptance, etc.) eventually end up being obsolete and no longer needed. 
About 25% of physical servers and 20% of virtual servers (VMs) become zombies, meaning they use resources while waiting to be used. 
This represents avoidable environmental and economic impacts.

Implementing an end-of-life plan can prevent this kind of situation.

A simple end-of-life plan is making someone responsible to decide when to stop the service. Their role would be to monitor this service's activity until they decide to stop it. 
Another method is to write an end-of-life scenario (expiration date, etc.) and allocate the appropriate budget from the start.
A third option would be to extend the service's lifespan.

Stopping a service involves:

- Releasing resources: decommissioning the service, its dependencies, tools used by the development team (e.g., Teams channel).
- Deleting, archiving, or otherwise managing data (including document management and bug tracking systems).
- Reallocating installations, equipments, and other project resources (including source code).
- Valuing skills acquired during the project's lifetime.

### Example

Several end-of-life scenarios are possible when migrating data or applications to a cloud environment:

- Copying and pasting the existing data or application to the cloud through decommissioning the old environment.
- Refactoring with architecture and code changes, which may question the existing environment. For example, challenge the unused functionalities kept for ulterior hypothetical use...
