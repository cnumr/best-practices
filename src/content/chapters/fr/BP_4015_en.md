### Description

The page title `<h1>`, along with its `<title>` equivalent, coupled with a relevant `<meta name="description">` tag, should be perfectly coherent with the associated page content. This kind of optimization matches users searches intents, avoiding unnecessary visits (back and forth to find the information they are looking for) and thereby shortening their travel time within search engines.

In addition,`<title>` and `<meta name="description">` elements are sometimes automatically used on social networks or when sharing links. Making sure about their quality ensures:

- Correct indexing of pages content by search engines and directories
- Websites and landing pages content identification
- Understanding content before accessing it
- Qualifying the associated page requested content or information being read
