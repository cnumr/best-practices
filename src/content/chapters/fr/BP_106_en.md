### Description

MySQL or MariaDB servers binary logs can become very large, consuming CPU cycles while generating input-output (I/O) HDD operations since each modification/deletion request is recorded into the log file. Disabling these logs will save a lot of resources. Before disabling, make sure that there is no need for a database replication and that the last backup data loss is acceptable.

### Example

For MySQL, add the following configuration:

```
skip-log-bin
```
