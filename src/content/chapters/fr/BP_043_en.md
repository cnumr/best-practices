### Description

Repaint refers to DOM elements change of appearance, while reflow refers to change / recalculation of their position.
Both of these operations are resource-intensive, especially in terms of CPU cycles, it is therefore 
necessary to avoid triggering them when possible.

### Example

Do not modify elements style properties (background color, border style, text color, size, etc.) to avoid repaints.

Limit changes of properties like position, dimension, type of positioning, content, ( etc.) to avoid reflows. 
This is particularly relevant for some HTML elements like tables, whose reflows might require up to three times more 
time than other elements.
