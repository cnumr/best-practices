### Description

The choice of the right technologies is very important to save resources : select the most efficient ones, depending on
the need and context.

For instance, using static pages for a site which content doesn't change much allow it to be cached, and will avoid
the deployment of application servers and databases.

In the case of a dynamic website, custom developments allow more relevant technical optimizations, and allow the use of the strict minimum to answer the user's needs.

If you have a part of a web application that relies on a small number of pages and deliver a bounded functional service 
(purchase, estimate request, ...), using a SPA (Single Page Application) may be interesting. It avoids requests and makes
the user experience more fluid.

### Example

A seldomly updated display site about an enterprise with a contact form should rely on static web pages.
