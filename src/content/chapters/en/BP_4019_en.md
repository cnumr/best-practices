### Description

It is essential to define what are the necessary features according to users when designing digital services. Responsive websites may entirely be sufficient and satisfying.

However, PWA (Progressive Web App) can spare double to triple developments and maintenance costs that would result from a native or hybrid mobile application (React native, Flutter) when a mobile applications is required and fully or partially reproduce the associated website.

PWA reduce mobile devices obsolescence risk and lower bandwidth use since they are not tied to operating systems (OS) and are often lighter than native mobile applications. This is why several social networks have developed PWA to conquer markets with low bandwidth networks.

### Example

- E-commerce sites (Lancôme, Starbucks, etc.)
- Media (L'équipe, Courrier International, Forbes, etc.)
- Software as a Service (Microsoft 365, Gmail, etc.)
- Social networks (Twitter Lite, Telegram, etc.)
- Business applications (SNCF, etc.)
