### Description

JavaScript/CSS animations can request a lot of CPU cycles and memory.

They all trigger resource-intensive (re)paint/(re)ï¬‚ow type actions. Animations must be avoided as much as possible, and only used when required.

If some animations are essential, stick to the CSS `opacity` and `transform` properties, and to the `translate`, `rotate`, `scale` related functions of `transform`. These two properties are automatically browser optimized, and the animations can be managed by the graphics processing unit (GPU). The following website [www.csstriggers.com](https://csstriggers.com/) features a list of DOM actions than con be triggered by an animation.

Browsers can be informed that an animation is going to take place with a `will-change` statement in order to reduce animation-related resource consumption.

### Example

```css
.box {
     will-change: transform, opacity;
}
```
### Alternative solution

You can also let the users choose whether or not to play animations via the browser preferences and the through `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries. Animations will only be played if no preferences have been set by the user.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference ) {
   .animation {
     animation: fadeIn 4s ease;
   }
}
```
