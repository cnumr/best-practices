### Description

Optimizing the user journey consists in reducing the time spent by the user on his most frequent use cases. 

Start by identifying the most frequent uses cases, then optimize them, by reducing the number of steps and 
actions, eliminating unnecessary ones, identifying the failure cases, optimizing response times, etc.

A user journey is well designed when the program behaves exactly as the user expects it.

The observation of the people using the service is a straightforward way to identify the points of friction, but user tests,
realised with real random users from the field are much more interesting. People working on and around the product
tend to be power users.

The time spent by the user on the terminal is the second largest environmental impact.

### Example

On e-commerce services : 
* Propose a new order based on the content of the previous order.
* Allow the users to buy things without registration
* Allow the user to Copy/Paste his or her IBAN directly rather than uploading it.
* Highlight the most used fields or filters.
