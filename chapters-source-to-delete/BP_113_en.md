### Description

Write short texts using a "direct" style. Use concise ideas formulations, even if it means developing on several pages of content if it is very long and/or includes many different notions.

Divide long contents into several pages.

### Example

If a topic requires a lengthy explanation, divide the content into multiple pages and/or provide it as downloadable document. This way, users will only display pages they want to read and only download files that are interesting to them.
