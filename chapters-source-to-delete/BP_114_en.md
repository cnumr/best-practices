### Description

Provide several formats (size, frame rate, audio compression, etc.) depending on the video watching context (desktop, Wi-Fi tablet, EDGE smartphone).

Video optimization should be done out of the website, ideally during post-production. If not possible, use services like YouTube or Vimeo since they offer several optimized formats (SD, HD, etc.) by default.

### Example

A 15-second user guide shot in 1,680 x 1,050 resolution weighs:

- 49 MB when not optimized;
- 3 MB when optimized for a resolution equal to or greater than 1,024 x 720 in MPEG 4/H.264/AAC;
- 1.2 MB when optimized for a resolution equal to or greater than 480 x 320 in MPEG 4/H.264/AAC.

It can be estimated that there is at least a 50% size gain (and probably savings during decoding, as the encoding format takes targeted hardware into consideration) between "desktop" and "mobile" video versions.

Most cases should be covered with 3 different sizes x 3 different encodings, i.e., 9 versions of the same video. It is possible to serve the right file with simple rules such as screen resolution with a responsive design logic.

### Validation rule
