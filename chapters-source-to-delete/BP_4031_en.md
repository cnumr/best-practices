### Description

Multimedia contents (images, sounds, videos) can improve user experience and services effectiveness. These contents are widely used in live information websites (e.g., e-commerce, news, events) and should be used wisely and optimized when transferred to user devices, as they are massively heavier than textual contents. When they are unpublished, i.e., inaccessible to end users, keeping them in storage often has no business interests. It is therefore necessary to set a deleting policy for these contents to avoid unnecessary storage use and freeing up space for new contents.
