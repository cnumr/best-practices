### Description

Virtualization allows creating and executing virtual representations of a computer on one or more physical machines. 
The virtualization software allocates resources between different virtual environments based on their needs.

As a result, virtualization allows:

- hardware savings through mutualisation
- optimal resources use (RAM, CPU, disk)

This method reduces the amount of electronic waste (WEEE) and energy use compared to multiple physical servers.

Containerization is another level of virtualization: virtual machines can host a container orchestration service, 
enabling execution of multiple applications in an isolated way on the same operating system.

### Example

Use virtualization tools such as VMware, Xen, KVM, etc.

Use containerization tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

It is more efficient to mutualise resources by using a hypervisor than using four dedicated servers for four projects, each running at maximum capacity of 20%. This way, a single physical machine can provide the same services as four dedicated servers.
