### Description

A circuit breaker interrupts requests processing to an external API when it's not responding.
Requests from user devices can use services for which a degraded mode is acceptable. These are called non-critical.
Depending on a several error criterias (timeout, number of errors, ...), the service that is calling a non-critical
external service can disable this call and immediately return an alternative response.
This pattern avoids unnecessarily soliciting service and network.

### Example

On e-commerce websites, some product sheet information can be provided by dedicated services.
When the main service that provide product page "learns" that the detailed information service encounters errors,
it stops calling it, avoiding unnecessarily failed calls, leaving to the external service to go back up and saving resources on both sides.
The service remains operational even though experience is degraded.
