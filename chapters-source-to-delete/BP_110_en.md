### Description

Double opt-in is a marketing practice of ensuring prospects consent, usually via electronic agreement, by ticking a box; and then validating by sending confirmation mails to the indicated addresses. The address status becomes double opt-in when recipients have clicked on the provided link in the received message. This process validates adresses and verifies that the person who provided it is the owner. This double verification confirms prospects' commitment to receive the newsletters, suscribption, etc.

It is therefore recommended to use the double opt-in practice to significantly reduce:

- the number of emails without real impact (and therefore bandwidth use);
- SMTP server load when sending the email campaign;
- server load when processing unsubscriptions.

### Example

In the case of a telephone operator or a bank: give customers a choice among a catalog of products or services for which they agree to be solicited for.
