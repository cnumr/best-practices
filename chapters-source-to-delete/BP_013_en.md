### Description

If a page is only modified twice a year, there's no use for a CMS: static pages are fine. Sticking to static pages will permit to save CPU, bandwidth, power, etc.

A CMS typically requires several software layers to display content: HTTP server, application server (the CMS itself), and database, with optional cache systems. A static page is directly served to the user by the file systemâ€™s HTTP server. There is no need for an application server or database.



### Example

The following solutions can be applied depending on the digital service:

-	For a landing page or a simple display site, a static page that is written directly in HTML, CSS (and optionally JS) can be created.
-	For a blog with low activity, a JAMstack architecture, with a content generator like Jekyll, Hugo, Gasby or Eleventy can be used. If necessary, a headless CMS or a headless flat-file CMS (Strapi, Contenful, Flextype, etc.) can be added.
-	for more complex web applications, some pages with low edit rate (FAQ, About, legal terms, ...) can be made static.
