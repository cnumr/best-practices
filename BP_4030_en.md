### Description
Carousels, that are often used to highlight multiple contents, quickly show limits in terms of conversion, which negatively impact user experience. Their presence implies several critical issues:
- Increased page size due to the presence of dedicated CSS and JavaScript, as well as each carousel screen content.
- Complexity in terms of web quality insurance and digital accessibility.
- Greater use of processor resources in the case of automatic carousels.

### Example

`<img />` tags have an HTML loading attribute that natively allows progressive images loading.
`<img src="mon_image.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" />`

Certain CSS attributes animations involve browser repaint/reflow, requiring machine resources. Prefer carousel animations using CSS transform property to limit this.


### Alternative solution

Limit the use of carousels as much as possible by prioritizing static content that is regularly updated. Otherwise:

- Implement simple and complete components control (stop, next/previous screen)
- Prefer progressive loading of images displayed on different screens.
- Prefer animations involving processor resources.
- Limit the number of screens in the carousel.
