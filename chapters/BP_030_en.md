### Description

Glyphs are specific typographic characters included in fonts, like those included in operating systems. They can be used to replace monochrome images such as symbols or pictograms (chevron, triangle, point, square, astrological signs, etc.) up to illustrations allowing:
- Reducing bandwidth by reducing website total size
- Reducing the number of queries
- Reducing DOM complexity, notably through various SVG pictograms

### Example

To optimize a landing page that visually includes:

*Excerpt from a font created via Font Forge*
![ to illustrate a landing page](https://github.com/florinesueur/images/blob/main/vue-font-forge.svg)


A 91% size saving was achieved by including pictograms and vector illustrations in an icon font via [Font Forge](https://fontforge.org/en-US/).
