### Description

Autocomplete is a popular feature that suggests search-related results when the user is typing.
For example, a site that allows you to find a route will suggest "Paris", "Lyon Part-Dieu" and "Paray le Monial" when the user types "Par".

The implementation of autocompletion usually consists in sending a request to the server for each character entered in order to retrieve the corresponding results.
This can result in many requests being sent and consume a lot of resources.

If possible, this functionality should be replaced by assisted input.
This consists of guiding the user through a set of information and advice:
- Presentation of the expected format in grey in the input field (`placeholder`)
- Text explaining the expected format
- Reaction of the interface with an error message or a change of color and textual help when the input is incorrect
- etc.

Interactions related to assisted input are managed locally, which reduces exchanges with the server.

For the example of searching for a route and entering a city, it is possible, in case of ambiguity, to propose
the different results after submitting the form. The user enters a string, for example "Lens",
submits the form, and is then offered different options: "Lens (France)", "Lens (Belgium)",
"Loison sous Lens".

If the use of autocompletion cannot be avoided, it is possible to minimize the number of requests with simple optimizations:
- Add a delay of a few tenths of a second between the addition of a character and the request: this allows not to trigger a query if the user has not finished typing.
- Limit the number of results displayed, prioritized by a score of relevance
- Set a minimum number of characters before trying to complete.
- If the size of the database allows it, include it in the html code or in the `local storage` and perform client-side autocompletion.
- Cache search results with the string entered as the key to reduce the load on the database.
- Contextualize the results to limit their number.

### Example

Potential gain: the number of requests might be reduced by a factor of 10.

### Alternative solution

If the data that is offered to the user is quite small, you can include it directly in your HTML code and use 
the native [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/ Web/HTML/Element/datalist).

This system will offer native and client side autocompletion mechanism.


```html
<label for="ice-cream-choice">Choose a flavor:</label>
<input list="ice-cream-flavors" id="ice-cream-choice" name="ice-cream-choice" />

<datalist id="ice-cream-flavors">
    <option value="Chocolate">
    <option value="Coconut">
    <option value="Mint">
    <option value="Strawberry">
    <option value="Vanilla">
</datalist>
```
