### Description

Choosing the appropriate theme is crucial when using a CMS. Themes add extensions and sometimes include page builders upon installation. Provided features are often far beyond users actual needs. Each extension adds its data, CSS and JS files, not to mention the number of files stored on the servers to make it all work. Depending on the development quality of the addons, additional assets can be heavy and/or redundant.

This causes:

- An increase in the number of requests
- An increase in page size
- An increase in processing time for internal requests
- An increase in content administration complexity

### Example

An all-in-one theme or one that includes a page builder can add features to put sliders in your articles, heavily personalize your action buttons, or let you integrate testimonials or create portfolios when you didn't plan to incorporate them into your content at all. Also, beware of incompatibilities caused by some of these extensions.

Choose simple themes providing essentials features. Then add features when they are really necessary.
