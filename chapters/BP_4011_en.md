### Description

Reducing the volume of stored data to the bare minimum implies:

- optimizing the management of large data volumes
- cleaning up old data, either by archiving it offline or deleting it
- ensuring that backups can be restored
- monitoring storage space size

Legal constraints may require to store data that is never used over time, depending on the type of data, and its owners.
The way the data is used and its importance degree also impacts how it will be stored.

This practice is part of the management of the information lifecycle.

### Example

- Define the archiving processes: upon release, an annual report is stored on an SSD (hot zone). One month later, it will be archived on a classic storage system (cold zone). Finally, ten years later, it will be deleted.
- Avoiding duplicates between tables is a way to optimize stored data volume.
- Data use can lead to tables denormalization and therefore increasing storage space
