### Description

Images often represent most of the downloaded bytes, right after videos and just before CSS and JavaScript libraries.
Optimizing images is important to reduce used bandwidth. The first step is to choose the ideal format for your
display needs.

Raster images should be reserved for photos and interface elements that cannot be displayed with icons or CSS styles.

The appropriate format depends on the image properties : black & white or color, color palette, need for transparency...
Among these properties, the possibility to irremediably alter images quality (lossy compression) tends to favor formats such as JPEG, JPEG XL,
AVIF, or WebP, while needing transparency and/or the impossibility to alter the image quality (lossless compression) will tend to favor
PNG or WebP lossless formats (which supports transparency).

Format importantly impacts images size: on average, .webp images will be 30% lighter than .jpeg
images or .png images. .avif images can be up to 20% lighter than .webp image and 50% lighter than .jepg images.

Don't forget to pay attention to browser support. .webp images will not be recognized by
old browsers and will not be displayed. It is possible to provide several formats for the same image 
to overcome this issue. Some server-side modules (such as Google's modPageSpeed, also available for Apache
and Nginx) even allow you to provide the appropriate image for the browser that is calling the server.

Many tools will help you minimize images size:

- SQUOOSH
- CLOUDINARY
- ImageMagick
- PngCrush
- JpegTran

### Example

In this example, the DOM <picture> element informs the browser that there are two images: a .webp image and a
.jpg image, which is used by default. The browser will decide which image will be downloaded. If the .webp format 
is supported, the image.webp image will be downloaded; otherwise, image.jpg image will be downloaded.

```html
<picture>
    <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="..." loading="lazy">
</picture>
```
